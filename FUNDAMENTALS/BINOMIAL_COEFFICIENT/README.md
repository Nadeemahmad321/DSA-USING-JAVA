# Binomial Coefficient (nCr) - Java Program

This Java program calculates the **binomial coefficient** \( nCr \), also known as **"n choose r"**. The binomial coefficient represents the number of ways to choose `r` elements from a set of `n` elements, where order does not matter.

The formula for calculating \( nCr \) is:

\[
nCr = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}
\]

Where:

- \( n! \) is the factorial of `n`
- \( r! \) is the factorial of `r`
- \( (n - r)! \) is the factorial of \( (n - r) \)

## How the Program Works

### 1. **User Input**:

- The program prompts the user to input two values: `n` (total number of elements) and `r` (number of elements to choose).
- It validates that the value of `n` must be greater than or equal to `r`.

### 2. **Factorial Calculation**:

- The program calculates the factorial of a number using the `factorial` method, which is responsible for calculating the product of all positive integers up to the number.

### 3. **Binomial Coefficient Calculation**:

- The program calculates \( nCr \) by applying the formula using the calculated factorials for `n`, `r`, and \( (n - r) \).

### 4. **Output**:

- The program outputs the value of \( nCr \) based on the user inputs.

## Example

If the user enters `n = 5` and `r = 3`, the program calculates:

\[
5C3 = \frac{5!}{3! \cdot 2!} = \frac{120}{6 \cdot 2} = 10
\]

### Sample Output:

```
The value of n must be greater than or equal to r!
Enter the value of n: 5
Enter the value of r: 3
The value of 5C3 is: 10
```

## Code Breakdown

### 1. **Factorial Calculation**:

The `factorial(int x)` method calculates the factorial of a number `x` by multiplying all integers from `1` to `x`.

```java
static int factorial(int x) {
    int fact = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= x; i++) {
        fact *= i;
    }
    return fact;
}
```

### 2. **Binomial Coefficient (nCr) Calculation**:

The `nCr(int n, int r)` method calculates the binomial coefficient using the formula:

```java
static int nCr(int n, int r) {
    int nFact = factorial(n); // Calculate n!
    int rFact = factorial(r); // Calculate r!
    int denominator = rFact * factorial(n - r); // Calculate (r! * (n-r)!)
    int nCrResult = nFact / denominator; // Apply the formula nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)
    return nCrResult;
}
```

### 3. **User Interaction and Output**:

The program asks the user for input values for `n` and `r`, calculates the result, and then displays the value of \( nCr \).

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

    // Prompt user for input values
    System.out.println("The value of n must be greater than or equal to r!");
    System.out.print("Enter the value of n: ");
    int n = sc.nextInt();
    System.out.print("Enter the value of r: ");
    int r = sc.nextInt();

    // Calculate and display the result
    int nCrResult = nCr(n, r);
    System.out.println("The value of " + n + "C" + r + " is: " + nCrResult);

    // Close the scanner to prevent resource leak
    sc.close();
}
```

### Key Functions:

1. **`factorial(int x)`**: Computes the factorial of a number `x`.
2. **`nCr(int n, int r)`**: Computes the binomial coefficient using the formula \( nCr = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \).
3. **`main()`**: Handles user input, calls the `nCr` method to calculate the result, and displays the output.

## How to Run the Program

### Prerequisites:

- You need to have **Java** installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
- A text editor or an IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VSCode is needed to write and run the code.

### Running the Program:

1. **Download or Clone the Repository**:

   - Download the Java file or clone the repository if it's hosted on a platform like GitHub.

2. **Compile the Program**:

   - Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the `Ncr.java` file is located.
   - Compile the program using the following command:
     ```bash
     javac Ncr.java
     ```

3. **Run the Program**:

   - Run the compiled program using the following command:
     ```bash
     java Ncr
     ```

4. **Enter Inputs**:
   - Enter the values for `n` and `r` when prompted, and the program will calculate and display the result.

## Conclusion

This program provides a simple implementation to calculate the binomial coefficient \( nCr \) using the formula \( nCr = \frac{n!}{r! \cdot (n - r)!} \). It's a great way to understand basic concepts in combinatorics, factorial calculations, and Java programming.

### Potential Enhancements:

- **Input Validation**: The program assumes the user provides valid input. We could add checks to ensure `n >= r` and handle invalid inputs like negative values.
- **Optimization**: The program calculates factorials multiple times (e.g., `factorial(n)` and `factorial(n-r)`). For larger values of `n`, this could be inefficient. Optimizing this part could make the program faster.
